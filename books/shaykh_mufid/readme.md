## My analysis
The book is not about life of Shaikh Mufid but also the time of his life. His time period was a period of relative calm period for Imami school of thought. There was a shia
dynasty named Buyud dynasty and thus the Shia minority got some political freedom and acknowledgement probably for the first time after occultation of 12th Imam. It would be nice
to read that how scholars like Sheikh Mufid dealt with this political freedom and what role the Buyud dynasy played in history of Imami school of thought.
